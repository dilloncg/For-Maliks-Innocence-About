  <h1>About</h1>
    <p1>Meet Malik Gary, Armstrong High School Graduate. He is thoughtful,
        intelligent, soft-spoken, a leader among his friends, and an all-around
        wonderful young man. While visiting family in Richmond in July 2020,
        he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was arrested for a
        serious crime of which I know he is innocent. This website is dedicated to
        sharing his story.</p1>
